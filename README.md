### App Store Key Take Away

- Use 30 character title, 29 character sub title, 80 character short description, 100 characters for keyword feild, use 10 or 8 screenshots, use 3 or 1 videos in preview

- Title has a huge impact on conversition rate. For example, "Hilly - Super Dating App" to "Hilly - Dating App for Singles" lead to 20% increase in app units/product page view, so use relevant title.

- Use seasonal metadatas (screenshots, icon, video). For example, hallowen, valentine, chrismas will have different design in USA. Consider these seasonal marketing assets based on localization. 

- Localization is critical to an app's success. Use tool like <a href = "https://crowdin.com/"> Crowdin </a> to automate app localization. Collect lots of feedback from translators on how you can improve app's user expereince for their language. 

- Focusing on high traffic keyword can sometimes be counter productive for a relatively new apps. Target long tail keywords with good traffic (ASA score above 20) and low compitition. 

- If you're unable to rank for any good traffic keyword, then consider low traffic keywords (ASA between 10 to 20) only if the difficulty is low enough. In App Radar, the difficulty score of 30 or below is considered low difficulty, whereas 70 is lot more difficult. 

- Number of apps ranking for a certain keyword is also an indicator for difficulty. If there are less than 100 apps ranking for a keyword, then it might have low difficulty, regardless of the diffuculty score. High traffic keyword with less number of apps are usually brand keywords. 

- ASA score grows exponential to the number of impressions (downloads). A score of 45 is way far better than 25. 

- We can use typo of certain popular keywords. 

- Keyword research tools: Apple Search Ads, App Follow, Mobile Action Recommendation & Keyword Spy, App Radar, <a href = "https://www.onelook.com/"> OneLook </a> 

- Using keywords we already rank for or algorithm think we are a good match (i.e. suggested by Apple Search Ads) should be our first consideration when selecting keywords
